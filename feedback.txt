This project was quite difficult but overall very interesting
I like how it was very practical; it makes for good experience
Specifically, some of the hardest things were setting up the VM
and dealing with network issues. I think that in order to improve
the project, there should be a clear listing of what expected output
should be and a very detailed explaination on what is expected and what
situations we don't have to handle.
